UAV Flight Controller Firmware

Version 0.0.1

This firmware is designed for a UAV flight controller based on the ESP32 development module. It integrates various sensors and modules, including:

MPU6050: 6-axis motion tracking sensor
BMP085: Barometric pressure sensor
HMC8663: 3-axis digital compass
GPS Module
nRF24L01: Wireless communication module for telemetry and control

Overview
This version of the firmware is specifically designed for a fixed-wing, single-propeller UAV. The PID values used in this firmware have been calibrated using a Simulink model and PID Tuner.

Features:
Integration with ESP32 for efficient processing and control
Real-time data acquisition from MPU6050 for accurate motion tracking
Altitude measurement using BMP085
Directional orientation with HMC8663
GPS module integration for precise location tracking
Telemetry and control capability using nRF24L01 for real-time flight data monitoring and wireless control
Optimized for fixed-wing, single-propeller UAVs
PID values finely tuned through simulation and modeling
Telemetry and Wireless Control
The firmware includes enhanced telemetry and control capabilities using the nRF24L01 module, allowing real-time monitoring and control of flight data. This feature provides crucial 

information such as:

UAV position (latitude, longitude, altitude)
Speed and heading
Sensor data (accelerometer, gyroscope, compass)
System status and alerts
The telemetry data can be transmitted to a ground station or a compatible receiver for real-time analysis, monitoring, and control. The nRF24L01 module facilitates wireless communication, enabling not only data reception but also sending control commands to the UAV.

Calibration and Tuning:
The PID values have been meticulously calibrated using Simulink Model and PID Tuner to ensure optimal performance and stability of the UAV during flight.

Installation:
To install the firmware, follow these steps:

Connect the ESP32 development module to your computer.
Load the firmware onto the ESP32 using your preferred method (e.g., Arduino IDE, PlatformIO).
Ensure all sensors and modules are properly connected and configured, including the nRF24L01 module.
Power on the UAV and verify sensor readings and module integrations.
Pair the nRF24L01 module with the ground station receiver for telemetry and control.

Usage
Once the firmware is installed and the UAV is powered on, the flight controller will manage the UAV's stability and navigation using the integrated sensors and GPS module. The telemetry system will provide real-time flight data, and the nRF24L01 module will enable wireless communication with the ground station. Adjustments to the PID values can be made if necessary by re-calibrating using Simulink and the PID Tuner.
